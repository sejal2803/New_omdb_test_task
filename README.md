# The Open Movie Database - OMDB Rails App

## Description

This is a Ruby 3.2.2 project using Rails 7.0.4. The project is designed to allow users to search for movies using the OMDB API (<https://www.omdbapi.com/>) and store reviews for movies. It utilizes PostgreSQL as the database.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Get the API keys from `https://www.omdbapi.com`. For development environment it is already in the Rails Credentials. Run the following command to check `EDITOR='code --wait' rails credentials:edit -e development`
- Make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your machine:
    - Docker
    - Docker Compose

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

#### Using Docker

1. Build the Docker images and start the containers by running the following command:
    `docker-compose up --build`
2. Once the containers are up and running, you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Manual Setup

1. Install the required Ruby version (3.2.2) using your preferred Ruby version manager.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
    `bundle install`
3. Configure the database connection in the `config/database.yml` file.
4. Create and set up the database by running the following commands:
    `rails db:create`
    `rails db:migrate`
5.  Start the Rails server by running:
    `rails server`
6.  The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Models

### Movie
The `Movie` model contains the following field:
- `imdb_id`: The IMDb ID of the movie.

### Review
The `Review` model is used to store reviews for movies. It contains the following fields:
- `title`: The title of the review.
- `content`: The content of the review.
- `rating`: The rating given to the movie in the review.

### External API
The project uses the OMDB API (<https://www.omdbapi.com/>) to search for movies based on title. The IMDb ID is stored in the `imdb_id` field of the `Movie` model. The API key for the OMDB API should be configured in the Rails credentials file (`config/credentials.yml.enc`).
